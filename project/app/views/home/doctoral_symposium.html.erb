				<h1 style="text-align: center;">1st Doctoral Symposium on Computational Intelligence (DoSCI 2020)</h1>
				<br><br>

				<h3>Objectives of the Doctorate Thesis Presentation</h3>
				<p>
				<p>The Doctoral Symposium:</p>

				<p>• To provide a platform for sharing the research ideas on an international level.<br>
				• To provide a platform to meet domain experts to discuss research concepts, methodologies and career issues. <br>
				• To provide a platform for scholars to make informal networks with their peers from other institutes.<br>
				• To discuss the real life benefits of the research work done for human welfare in the light of research done during Ph.D.<br>
				• To apply the research developed during the PhD in other inter-disciplinary areas. <br>
				• Will allow the researchers who have just completed the research work of their PhD<br>
				to explore the new areas coming out of their completed research work by publishing a novel work stating the future of their research work.<br>
				• Will give new light, ideas and dimension to the researchers doing their PhD by presenting their future work. <br>
				• It is an opportunity for the people who have completed their PhD to summarize their research work into a single paper explaining the journey of their research with the most important result works and possible future areas coming out of their research work (Phd++). <br>
				• A panel comprised of high profile national and international researchers will give the author suggestions for the future direction of your research work after the careful examination of your work. </p>

				<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
				<p>
						We invite submission for the following two tracks.<br>
						<ul style="list-style: disc;">
							<li><b>Track 1:</b> Research Design presentation - Papers are invited from those scholars who are in their initial stages of PhD. Research scholars who have completed their course work and have made progress in research proposal are expected to participate. Participants in this track are not expected to present any estimation results and are requested to follow the following structure for paper submission:
							Introduction, Extensive literature survey, Research gaps, Objectives, Proposed Hypothesis, Proposed Methodology, Expected contribution to the literature.
							</li>
							<li><b>Track 2:</b> Advanced research paper presentation - Track two is for scholars who are in their advanced stages of thesis or have just completed their PhD. Research scholars who have made progress in thesis work and are near to submission/ submitted and waiting for defence are expected to participate. It is also important for the researchers who have just completed their PhD or Post Doc or M tech. to summarize their research work in a single short paper with describing the future direction of your work with new findings or results. Participants are requested to follow the following structure for paper submission: Introduction, Extensive literature review, Research gaps, Objectives, Hypothesis, Methodology, interpretation of results, Conclusion and policy or managerial implications, and future outcomes or areas of their research work.</li>
							
						</ul>
